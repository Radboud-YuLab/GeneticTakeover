# GeneticTakeover
Evolutionary selection of DNA genomes over RNA genomes by a stoichiometric selection advantage.

## Getting started
To get started, navigate to `1_code` and run `genetic_takeover_main.m`.
To re-draw figures without re-running simulations, navigate to `1_code` and run `genetic_takeover_draw_figs.m`.
